## Hello! 

This repository is a sample of my schoolwork from this fall semester. Each branch is a different assignment that I have implemented during this course. This wiki covers the basic setup you will need to run any assignment. 

Each branch is exactly the same except for the 'studentaiplayer.py' file (in AI folder). 
Running each game will be the exact same, after you have the proper environment setup. Once that is done simply follow my _Running The Game_ section of the wiki. 

### PREREQUESITES 
In order to run any game, please download python 2.7.10. 
Also download pygame. It is an open source software that allows you to run the game of "Antics". You can find a version at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. NOTE: The installation of pygame onto a Mac OSx system is not robust, on my Mac I had to follow the 'homebrew install instructions' link and install it from my terminal window. 

### RUNNING THE GAME
Run the file 'game.py' with your python 2.7.10 interpreter that has pygame installed to it. 
A game GUI will pop up. You can do human vs AI, AI vs AI, or Tournament mode (lets you simulate as many games as you want). 

Thanks for checking this out!
